# Tcl Out-of-bounds List Access
This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl: accessing a list element using an index that is out of bounds. The `bug.tcl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs because the example tries to access an index that does not exist within the list.  The solution demonstrates proper error handling and input validation to prevent this type of issue.
